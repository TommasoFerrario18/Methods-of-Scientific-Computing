# Methods of Scientific Computing

This repository contains the material for the project of the course "Methods of
Scientific Computing" at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

The project is divided in two parts:

1. The first part is about the implementation of iterative methods for the
solution of linear systems of equations.
1. The second part is about the implementation of the Discrete Cosine Transform
for image compression.
